export const serviceFaqs = {
  'spring-replacement': [
    { q: 'How long does spring replacement take?', a: 'Most spring replacements are completed in 45–60 minutes. We carry a full range of springs on every truck, so same-day service is the norm across Ottawa.' },
    { q: 'Do you replace one spring or both?', a: 'We always recommend replacing both springs at the same time. If one broke, the other is near the end of its life; replacing both avoids a second service call within months.' },
    { q: 'What if my door has extension springs instead of torsion?', a: 'We service both. Extension springs are common on older doors; we replace them in pairs with quality hardware and correct safety cables.' },
  ],
  'opener-repair': [
    { q: 'Do you work on all opener brands?', a: 'Yes. We repair and install LiftMaster, Chamberlain, Genie, Craftsman, Marantec, and other major brands. We stock common parts on our trucks.' },
    { q: 'Can you program my remotes and vehicle Homelink?', a: 'Yes. We program wall consoles, remotes, and vehicle Homelink as part of the service at no extra charge.' },
    { q: 'How do I know if I need repair or a new opener?', a: 'We’ll give you an honest assessment. Many openers can be repaired (e.g. gear replacement). If the unit is very old or damaged, we’ll recommend replacement and explain the options.' },
  ],
  'opener-gear-replacement': [
    { q: 'How long does gear replacement take?', a: 'Typically 1–2 hours. We carry common gear kits and can usually complete the job the same day.' },
    { q: 'Will this fix grinding or clicking noises?', a: 'Yes. Grinding or clicking with the motor running is usually caused by worn plastic or metal drive gears. Replacing the gear assembly restores quiet, reliable operation.' },
  ],
  'emergency-repair': [
    { q: 'How fast can you get here?', a: 'We aim to arrive in under 90 minutes across Ottawa. We prioritize emergency calls and dispatch from our local team.' },
    { q: 'Do you charge more for evenings or weekends?', a: 'No. We don’t charge an overtime premium. You get the same transparent pricing 24/7.' },
    { q: 'What if you can’t fix it the same day?', a: 'We carry springs, cables, rollers, and common opener parts on every truck. Most emergencies are fixed on the first visit; if a part must be ordered, we’ll secure the door and schedule the finish.' },
  ],
  'new-door-installation': [
    { q: 'Do you remove the old door?', a: 'Yes. Removal and disposal of your old door are included in our installation service.' },
    { q: 'How long does installation take?', a: 'Typically 4–8 hours depending on door size and whether an opener is included. We’ll give you a clear timeframe when we quote.' },
    { q: 'Can I get an insulated door for Ottawa winters?', a: 'Yes. We offer insulated steel doors with R-12 to R-18 values to reduce heat loss and keep your garage warmer.' },
  ],
  'cable-repair': [
    { q: 'Do you replace one cable or both?', a: 'We always replace both lift cables. Replacing only one leaves the other as a weak point and can lead to another failure soon.' },
    { q: 'How long does cable repair take?', a: 'Most cable repairs are completed in 1–2 hours. We use quality cable and hardware and test the door before we leave.' },
  ],
  'panel-repair': [
    { q: 'When do you recommend repair instead of a new door?', a: 'When the door is structurally sound and the damage is limited to one area (e.g. one dented panel, rust at the bottom), repair is often the best value. We’ll tell you honestly if replacement makes more sense.' },
    { q: 'Do you replace whole panels?', a: 'We prefer to repair when possible to save you money. If a full panel replacement is needed, we can quote that; we don’t push unnecessary replacements.' },
  ],
  'weatherstripping': [
    { q: 'When is the best time to replace weather seals?', a: 'Fall is ideal so your door is sealed before winter. We also do replacements year-round when seals are cracked or missing.' },
    { q: 'What warranty do you offer on seal work?', a: 'We offer a 2-year warranty on our weather seal installation.' },
  ],
  'maintenance-tune-up': [
    { q: 'How often should I get a tune-up?', a: 'We recommend once a year. Many Ottawa homeowners book in the fall to avoid winter breakdowns.' },
    { q: 'What’s included in the 21-point inspection?', a: 'We lubricate all moving parts, test safety sensors and auto-reverse, check spring tension and track alignment, and inspect cables and brackets. You get a clear report and recommendations.' },
  ],
